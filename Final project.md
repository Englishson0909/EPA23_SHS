# Title: Pronunciation curriculum development focused on intonation

## 1.	Target group: 

The English Conversation course is designed for second-year students, aged 16 to 17 years old. These students have been studying English for a total of 9 years, with a primary focus on reading and grammar. However, they have recently started participating in English conversation classes since March. The students are highly interested in developing their communication skills. The class consists of 10 students, with an equal distribution of 5 females and 5 males. Their English proficiency level is considered to be low-intermediate, as determined by their mid-term scores.

## 2.	The curriculum duration: 6-week course, intensive listening and speaking course
- 1st week: Class orientation (Goal, introduction of intonation, diagnostic test)
- 2nd week: Lesson on intonation on statements (rising/fall) 
- 3rd week: Lesson on Intonation on Yes/no Questions and practice (rising/fall) 
- 4th week: Lesson on Intonation on Wh-Questions and practice (rising/fall)
- 5th week: Communicative practice with game
- 6th week: Evaluation & Feedback 

## 3.	Learning objectives: 
-	Students can learn how to pronounce Wh-questions (questions that start with words like "who," "what," "where," etc.) and Yes or No questions by paying attention to the intonation. 
-	The goal of this curriculum is to help students get getter at using intonation in English by practicing different ways of speaking with rising and falling tones. 
-	Studentsâ€™ progress will be measured by PRAAT, which can record the intonation of students with high and low pitch. 
-	The task and activities will be matched with levels of students, and gradually challenging to improve the intonation of students. 
-	Learning intonation is important because it helps students communicate better in English. It lets them show their feelings, attitudes, and what they mean in a clearer way. This makes conversations more interesting and easier to understand. It also helps them get better at saying words correctly and speaking more smoothly. 
-	This curriculum will be conducted over a period of 6 weeks, with classes scheduled once a week, each lasting for 90 minutes. 

## 4. Sample Lesson
- Lesson objectives: Students will be able to produce correct intonation when using wh-questions and yes/no questions.
- Warm-up activities: words Quiz  & video clip [![Video Description](video_thumbnail.jpg)](video_JN5bcygghLA)

- Instructional materials and methods (e.g., worksheet, Video clip, google translate, etc.)
- Practice activities: individual tasks, group work 
- Assessment and feedback methods: recordings analyzed with Praat for formative and summative test
- Homework assignments: to make their own recording file with 10 sentences, which is including 5 Wh-questions and 5 Yes/no questions.    
- Extra resources for further practice or self-study: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text

## 5.	Incorporate technology: Integrate Praat and AI tools 
-	Using Praat: Praat provide visual results of high and low condor clearly, so Praat can be a good tool for evaluating and improving their intonation.  
- Google translage: easy to use and easy to access for student who want to translate L1 into L2

## 6.	Design assessments: recordings analyzed with Praat 
-	Rising intonation: measure the presence and appropriateness of rising intonation patterns, typically used in Yes/no questions, seeking for new information 
1)	presence: Is the rising intonation pattern consistently used in appropriate context? 
2)	Appropriateness: Is the rising intonation pattern accurately use to signal yes/no questions?

-	Falling intonation: Assess the presence and accuracy of falling intonation patterns
1)	Presence: Is the falling intonation pattern consistently used? (Yes/No)
2)	Clarity: Does the falling pitch contour show a clear and consistent downward movement? (Yes/No)

-	Grading 
1)	Excellent: To demonstrate consistent presence, appropriateness, in the case of rising intonation, or consistent presence, and clarity in the case of falling intonation
2)	Good: To show mostly consistent presence, appropriateness, in the case of rising intonation, or consistent presence, and clarity in the case of falling intonation, 	
3)	Fair: To displays inconsistent presence, appropriateness, in the case of rising intonation, or inconsistent presence, or clarity in the case of falling intonation, with noticeable irregularities 
4)	Poor: to shows rare or absent presence, inaccuracies, in the case of rising intonation, or frequent errors, lack of accuracy, lack of clarity, or significant irregularities in the case of falling intonation
